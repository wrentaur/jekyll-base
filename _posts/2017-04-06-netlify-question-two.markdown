My favorite thing about customer support is solving problems. When I see a problem, I don’t just want to fix it; I want to know why it happened and resolve it in a way that means that issue won’t ever happen again. 

Even better is preempting a problem before it happens. I like to really explore and play with whatever systems or tools I'm working with to preempt issues when possible. Basically, my heart wants to follow the motto ‘if it’s not broke, let's break it and make it better.’
