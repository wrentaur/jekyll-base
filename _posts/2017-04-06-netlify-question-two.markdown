My favorite thing about customer support is solving problems. I am obsessed with solving problems. When I see a problem, I am filled with an exhilarating, intense urge to investigate, understand, and solve that problem. I don’t just want to fix it; I want to know why the problem happened and resolve it in a way that means that issue won’t ever happen again. 

Even better is preempting a problem before it happens. I like to really explore and play with whatever system or tools I'm working and pay close attention to user data to preempt issues when possible. Basically, my heart wants to follow the motto ‘if it’s not broke, let's break it and make it better.’
