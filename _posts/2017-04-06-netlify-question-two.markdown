I am obsessed with solving problems. When I see a problem, I am filled with an exhilarating, intense urge to investigate, understand, and solve that problem. I don’t just want to fix it; I want to know why the problem happened and resolve it in a way that means that issue won’t ever happen again. Even better is preempting a problem before it happens. Basically, my heart wants to follow the motto ‘if it’s not broke, let's break it and make it better.’
