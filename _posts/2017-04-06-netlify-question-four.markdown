Since time was a factor, while making my site I tried to thoughtfully take a path of low resistance. When I looked over the static generators I had access to on the StaticGen site, I went with the Jekyll generator because Jekyll was the only option I already had experience with.  

My next step was to explore the configuration of the template the generator provided and determine a strategy to get what I needed out of the site (clearly displaying my responses in accessible) while working efficiently with the template features. Since it was a blog template, I made each question and answer a blog post and changed the the index page so the entire content of each post was visible.

My biggest challenge was simply that fact that I only had a little experience with Markdown. However, since itâ€™s a very simple language and GitHub has excellent documentation on Markdown use, I was able to research and learn as I went. The other important tool for managing this issue and making the site in general was the Chrome **inspect element** tool, which is my guiding star for troubleshooting html and CSS.
