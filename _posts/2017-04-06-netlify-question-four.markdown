Since time was a factor, while making my site I tried to thoughtfully take a path of low resistance. When I looked over the static generators I had access too on the StaticGen site, I went with the Jekyll generator because Jekyll was the only option I already had experience with.  

My next step was to explore the configuration of the template the generator provided and determine a strategy to get what I needed out of the site (mainly clearly displaying my responses in an accessible way) while working efficiently with the template features. Since it was a blog template I made each question and answer a blog post and changed the style and format of the way the site displayed those posts so all the answers could be read on the main page. 
My biggest challenge was simply that fact that I only had a little experience with Markdown. However, since itâ€™s a very simple language and GitHub has excellent documentation on Markdown use, I was able to research and learn as I went. The other important tool for managing this issue and making the site in general is the Chrome **inspect** element tool, which is my guiding star for troubleshooting code in any situation.
