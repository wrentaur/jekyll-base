The main challenge for a less technical users trying to do DNS configuration is simply understanding the task at hand. When I have had to walk someone through troubleshooting DNS configuration who isn’t very tech savvy they can sometimes shut down or become overwhelmed because of the unfamiliar terminology. I think it’s part of a very human response to feel like if something is unfamiliar you just can’t get it. 

Assuming a person does have their game face on for going outside their tech comfort zone I think another tricky area is simply correctly formatting the DNS records. Depending on what CMS they are using and where their domain is being hosted what kind of DNS records are needed and how they need to be formatted can vary. This means if the person trying to google their way through DNS configuration they are a bit at the mercy of what the documentation is like for their situation and they need to make sure they are looking at a walk through that corresponds to their specific situation.
