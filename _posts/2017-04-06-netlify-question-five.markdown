The only suggestion I have is to change one word that I found a bit ambiguous in the job posting.  The posting is obviously meant to be inclusive based on the writing style. I think it succeeds except for the use of the word **conversant**. 

First, I have a pretty nerdy vocabulary and I had to look this word up. I understood the general gist from context but since itâ€™s used to describe skill levels required for the job, I wanted to know exactly what it meant. 

My second issue is that once I looked up the definition, I found **conversant** could mean either a casual or an expert familiarity, so I found the word ambiguous.
