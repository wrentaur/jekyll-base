The only suggestion I have is to change one word that I found a bit ambiguous in the job posting. It is obvious the posting is meant to be inclusive based on the writing style and I think it is except for the use of the word **conversant**. My issue with this word use is two fold. 

First, I have a pretty nerdy vocabulary and I had to look this word up. I did get the general gist from context but since itâ€™s used to describe skills levels required for the job, I wanted to know exactly what it meant. 

My second issue is once I looked up the definition I found **conversant** could mean a casual or expert familiarity, so I was still confused about the meaning in this context.
