I really enjoyed using netlify for this project!

First of all, the quick and easy integration process with my GitHub account was amazing!

Second, how clean and clear the layout is made learning the tool very enjoyable. Everything was easy to find and navigate and the prominence of the **browse site**, **lock deploy**, and **view log** tools really helped me hit the ground running since those were the tools I needed to get started.

The last thing I want to mention is how helpful it is to have the deploy menu since it’s much more efficient to wait for the ‘success’ deploy status when trying to view a page update instead of just spamming the refresh button like I usually do.
