I really enjoyed using Netlify for this project!

First of all, the quick and easy integration process with my GitHub account was amazing!

Second, how clean and clear the layout is made learning the tool very enjoyable. Everything was easy to find and navigate and the prominence of the **browse site**, **lock deploy**, and **view log** tools really helped me hit the ground running since those were the tools I needed to get started.

I also want to mention how helpful it is to have the deploy menu since it’s much more efficient to wait for the `success` deploy status when trying to view a page update instead of just spamming the refresh button like I usually do.

The only difficulty I had came up while working on the bonus question. I spent about 2.5 hours on the bonus question, and 2hrs of that was simply combing over every inch of my site and Netlify to figure out why my redirects folder wasn’t working. Eventually I figured out that since I was working with Jekyll I needed to add an include in my config file so my redirect folder wouldn’t be ignored. I think it would be really helpful if the Netlify documentation about redirects mentioned that detail for Jekyll users.
