The main importance of SSL/HTTPS all comes down to security. Many common online activities involve submitting sensitive information like contact or credit card information to servers. Without safeguards this information can be intercepted on the way to the intended server or people can be tricked into submitting their information to fraudulent sites.
SSL/HTTPS functions as a pretty comprehensive safeguard for the above security issues. Data on the way to servers is encrypted so it is only accessible once it has arrived at it’s intended destination. 
SSL/HTTPS also helps prevent users from being tricked into submitting information to a fake site since legitimate websites asking for that kind of information will likely need an SSL certificate, which (in theory) only comes after thorough vetting.  
There are other aspects to SSL/HTTPS use like it increasing google rankings but that also comes back to security, since google’s preference comes from the SSL certification backing up the legitimacy of the site.
