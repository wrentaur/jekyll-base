The importance of SSL/HTTPS all comes down to security. Many common online activities involve submitting sensitive information like contact or credit card information to servers. SSL/HTTPS provides the following safeguards:

*SSL/HTTPS functions as a pretty comprehensive safeguard for the above security issues. Data on the way to servers is encrypted so it is only accessible once it has arrived at it’s intended destination.   

*SSL/HTTPS also helps prevent users from being tricked into submitting information to a fake site since legitimate websites asking for that kind of information will likely need an SSL certificate, which (in theory) only comes after thorough vetting.  

SSL/HTTPS also does other things like increasing Google rankings and this is also related to security as Google’s preference comes from the SSL certification backing up the legitimacy of the site.
