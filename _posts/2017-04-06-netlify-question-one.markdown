These are a few of my favorite Things [(off the provided list)](https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6): 

  1. Suggest and champion improvements to the product and workflow to your colleagues in and out of support
  2. Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers
  3. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
  4. Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product
  5. Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup  
  
  
None of the options [(off the provided list)](https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6) were unexciting, but here are the ones I find least interesting:  

  1. Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers  
  2. Find and recruit teammates for the support team  
  3. Manage a support team  
  4. Help train and onboard new support teammates  
  5. Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems
