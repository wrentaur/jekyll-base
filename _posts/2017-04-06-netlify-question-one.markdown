These are my favorite Things [(off the provided list)](https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6) with number 1 being the most exciting: 

  1. Suggest and champion improvements to the product and workflow to your colleagues in and out of support
  2. Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers
  3. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
  4. Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup
  5. Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product  
  
  
None of the options [(off the provided list)](https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6) were unexciting, but here are the ones I find least interesting, with number 1 being the least interesting:  

  1. Manage a support team   
  2. Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers  
  3. Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems 
  4. Find and recruit teammates for the support team  
  5. Help train and onboard new support teammates
