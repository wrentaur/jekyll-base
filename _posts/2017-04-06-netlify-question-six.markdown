Developer focused documentation that I really appreciate is [the documentation for the Slack API](https://api.slack.com/). 

From the get go, this documentation screams user friendly with choices that make the layout really engaging and digestible. These wonderful choices include:

- a layout with a lot of open, white space which allows the dense content to be very easy on the eyes. 
- Great use of formatting, graphics, headings, and colors to clearly denote and separate sections in a way that keeps the user on a clear path. 
- Color and graphic use that is fun and engaging but applied with a light hand, so these details serve to emphasise and not distract.
- The navigation menu on the side makes it easy to get to the content you want and keep track of where the content you are reading falls in the grand scheme of the API documentation.  

The content is also really top notch in a wide range of ways including:

- Conveying complex ideas with simple, accessible language that has a personal tone. The API documentation is talking to the user directly and gives an impression that keeping you engaged and on track is the number one priority.
- The content regularly uses devices like step-by-step breakdowns, bulleted lists, and specific examples to ensure clarity and help the user apply these concepts in practice.
- There are numerous screenshots inserted that provide clarity and a more tangible context for the operations being covered. 
- There are frequent links and calls to action that make the user feel empowered to immediately apply concepts or investigate them further without being too distracting.

All in all, I think the Slack API documentation does a great job of making dense and technical information really accessible and frequently exciting. It doesnâ€™t just give you a breakdown of functionality, it really inspires you to explore and experiment with their application.
