Hello Amira,

A lot of things could be going on to prevent a successful build of your site and the most common cause of this problem is when the versions of the build tools you are using on your local machine are different from the versions we are using. [Here is an article that talks about version conflicts and the build process in general](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/18/how-our-build-bots-build-sites/) that might be helpful for you.  

To give you additional help, I’d love to learn more about your specific situation. Are you using continuous or manual deployment? What build tools you are using? Could you please attach a copy of the log report for the failed build for me to review? You can get to the log report by going to the **deploy** tab on your site dashboard and then hitting the **view log** button.  

Thanks, 

-Irenka
