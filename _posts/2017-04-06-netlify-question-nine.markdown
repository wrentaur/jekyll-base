Hello Amira,

There are a lot of things that could be going on to prevent a successful build of your site, but the most common cause of this problem is when the versions of the build tools you are using on your local build software are different from the versions we are using. [Here is an article that talks about that issue](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/18/how-our-build-bots-build-sites/) as well as the build process in general that might be helpful for you. 

To give you additional help, I’d love to learn more about your specific situation like if you are using continuous or manual deployment and what build tools you are using. Also, could you attach a copy of the log report for the failed build. You can get to the log report by going to the **deploy** tab on your site dashboard and then hitting the **view log** button.  

Thanks, 

-Irenka
