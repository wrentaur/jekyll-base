**Main Exercise Summary**
The main exercise (everything except the bonus question) took about 6.5hrs. This included about an hour of non-essential cosmetic tinkering with the site I did just because I was having fun. I also think I was slowed down a bit because I am getting over mono and my fatigue forced me to work on this in 9 short sprints instead of longer dedicated work sessions. 

**Bonus Question**
This bonus question took an additional 2.5hrs. Two of these hours were spent combing through every aspect of my site and doing ALL THE GOOGLING to figure out why my redirects file wasn’t being recognized. So, two hours spent learning the important lesson that Jekyll ignores files that start with an underscore unless you add an include, 30 minutes learning and executing Netlify redirects. Also, I didn’t know splat functions were even a thing and they make me feel like a god!

**My Impressions**
The exercise was hard but a lot of fun! It really pushed my pre-existing knowledge to it’s limits and I did a lot of googling to fill in knowledge gaps. I think that if I did some more research and practice on my own and was using this knowledge on a daily basis, I could get comfortable working in a position like this. 
This exercise also gave me a clearer idea of my knowledge gaps and a lot of the resources I found while performing this exercise will be a great place to start learning. 

Even though working with mono slowed me down, that also puts me at ease about what doing this kind of work would be like on a bad health day. Even though this wasn’t quite my best, I still feel good about what I was able to do. So, all-in-all, this was a really helpful litmus test for me!
